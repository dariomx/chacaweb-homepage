<h2 id="intro">Who is Chacaweb?</h2>
<p>
   I was nick-named at a young age as "el chacal" (spanish for "the jackal"),
   thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBfAUXofkxA">this
   guy</a>. Thus, during my youth I had the custom of prefixing everything
   relative to myself with "chaca", eg my CSS stylesheet was named
   "chaca-style.css", the tacos I eat were "chaca-tacos", the ladies I admire
   were "chaca-lobas", etc ... you get the idea. It was a natural extension
   then to prefix my Bsc thesis the same way, and since it was about building
   webapps declaratively, the natural choice was "chaca-web" or just "chacaweb"
   (could roughly stand for "the web of the jackals", or something like that).
</p>
<p>
   The problem was, that my thesis director considered that such name evoked the
   "chaca-chaca" slogan from <a
   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovVnl-dHWGw">this soap commercial</a>,
   and then I was asked to change it (my priority was to finish the thesis
   quickly, so I did not argue much). The story was known by some of my friends
   at the University, and soon after some of them nicknamed me as "chacaweb".
   Given that I conceived the name myself I did not matter much, actually liked
   it. I do not speak that often with those friends, and the name kinda brings
   me nostalgy about my college days. Therefore, having a web presence (this
   page), gave me the perfect excuse to resurrect the legendary "chacaweb" name.
