<h2 id="intro">Who is Chacaweb?</h2>
<p>
   I was nick-named at a young age as "el chacal" (spanish for "the jackal"),
   thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBfAUXofkxA">this
   guy</a>. Thus, during my youth I got the habit of prefixing everything
   relative to myself with "chaca", eg my CSS stylesheet was named
   "chaca-style.css", the tacos I eat were "chaca-tacos", the ladies I admire
   were "chaca-lobas", etc ... you get the idea. It was a natural extension
   then to prefix my Bsc thesis the same way, and since it was about building
   webapps declaratively, the natural choice was "chacaweb" (could roughly
   stand for "the web of the jackals", or something like that).
</p>
<p>
   The problem was, that my thesis director considered that such name evoked the
   "chaca-chaca" slogan from <a
   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovVnl-dHWGw">this soap commercial</a>,
   and then I was asked to change it (my priority was to finish the thesis
   quickly, so I did not argue much). The story was known by some of my friends
   at the University, and soon after some of them nicknamed me as "chacaweb".
   Given that I conceived the name myself I did not matter much, actually liked
   it. I do not speak that often with those friends, and the name kinda brings
   me nostalgy about my college days. Therefore, having a web presence (this
   page), gave me the perfect excuse to resurrect the legendary "chacaweb" name.

<h2>What da frog is this page for?</h2>
<p>
   Well, after 20 years of working as employee on IT industry, I got an
   uncontainable need for doing my own thing. What I mean is that I have always
   created or modified software, based on someone else's ideas; which is not
   necessarily bad, it gives you some experience and brings food to the table.
   But after a long time I wonder: if all those guys have created great
   software/services, and acquired valuable skills in the process; why can't I
   do the same thing with "my own" ideas? I want to certainly leverage
   accumulated knowledge, but even if you take that as the baseline, there are
   still millions of variants where it comes to creating a concrete product or
   service. Many opportunities then to imprint your personal touch into
   something, as long as you own it.
</p>
<p>
   On this page then, you will find an entry point to my personal projects;
   things I do just for the sake of creating something myself. Whether that
   stuff will also become valuable for others, well, is not for me to say. I
   just know
   that I need to create stuff or I will die out of frustration. Merely
   writing this web page gives me a little peace, cause it is "something"
   concrete made by myself. I wish I could spend more time on these projects,
   but you know, I have the bad habit of eating three times a day; and since
   these projects are educational for now, they only get my spare time (whatever
   is left after working full time and attending the needs of the flesh).
