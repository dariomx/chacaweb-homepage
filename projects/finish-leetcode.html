<p>
   As it may be inferred from the <a href="/#intro">introduction</a>,
   I studied CS a long time ago (back in 1996). By the time I was spit out into
   the industry, the panorama was quite different than today; on interviews you
   were pretty much asked about concrete technology. "Have you used programming
   language X, or RDBMS Y?", were typical questions and sometimes were
   accompanied by practical programming exercises.
</p>
<p>
   Today's panorama for a college graduate in CS is quite different;
   knowing concrete technologies is not the main filter, but algorithm
   questions are. I guess Google started the trend and nowadays every
   company, from the startup to the corporate dinosaurs, just follow it. The
   rational is that such questions measure the really important skills
   (problem solving), and that technologies can be learned easily. I guess
   that I
   agree with the idea, except for the fact that I studied those topics two
   decades ago; and never really embraced frequently that kind of questions.
   Because of that, along with my particular way of thinking, I found
   extremely challenging to solve those problems under the clock. I
   literally feel this is a skill that I am slowly developing throughout the
   years, specially because time investment has not been consistent.

   I started trying on several platforms until I friend recommended me <a
     href="http://leetcode.com">leetcode</a>. IHMO, it has the richest set of
   questions and a great community to learn from; the solutions
   and explanations posted by some members are almost surreal, many things to
   learn there. My first personal project then, is to finish all leetcode
   questions; the almost 1500+ algorithm problems (circa 2020). It looks almost
   like an
   impossible task, specially due the hard problems, but that is precisely why I
   should do it. My leetcode user is
   <a href="https://leetcode.com/de_mexico/">de_mexico</a>, and I backup my
   solutions in the <a href="https://gitlab.com">gitlab</a> repo below:
