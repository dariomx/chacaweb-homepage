<h1 class="centered">Finish Leetcode</h1>

<p>
   For a period of my life, I thought that solving all
   <a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/finish-leetcode.html">leetcode's
      algorithm-problems</a>
    was going to give me the wisdom/confidence
   I was looking for.
   I did not finish the thing but just half of it (circa 2020); contrary
   to <a
     href="https://twitter.com/programmercoach/status/1310699848761401344">
   this guy</a>, who actually spent 4 years solving them all. Sigh,
   that means finishing leetcode is not even original anymore :-)

   I really enjoyed (and suffered) my hours spent at leetcode,
   and hopefully learned
   one or two tricks (even if the effort was not entirely
   consistent nor continuous). It became clear though, that
   mastering this skill requires a serious
   investment of time; you could
   even make a career out of algorithm-problems solving! But for the
   time being, I think I would rather go with a different path;
   perhaps in the DBMS field. Writing this page then, is kind of closing
   this chapter of my career; behold my testament at leetcode, for the
   generations to come:
