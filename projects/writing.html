<p>
   Some friends have told me, through the years, that I have some
   writing skills. That may be true, but, I do not consider possessing
   yet the required command of the language. It is such a marvelous
   tool, nevertheless, quite complex and deserving further studies.
   Regardless of whether I ever find the time to polishing my language
   skills, if I ever publish something it will be most likely here.
   Some will be in Spanish, my mother tongue; excuses to those not
   speaking it.
